# OnlineMeritBasedHostelAdmission
The project aims to solve the hostel admission problem faced by many students and a system was developed that considers the distance of student's hometown from the institute, merit, gender, and reservations which were the parameters provided by the Educational Department. The main problem to be solved was to filter students for the hostel by maintaining transparency in the admission procedure. The project was part of "Smart Gujarat for New India Hackathon 2018".Our participation was in both, regional round and final round.
